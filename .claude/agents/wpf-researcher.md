- IME integration in WPF applications
- Per-monitor DPI awareness
- Clipboard operations
- System tray (NotifyIcon) integration

## Research Guidelines

1. Search for official Microsoft documentation first
2. Look for proven patterns in open-source projects
3. Note any caveats or edge cases
4. Provide code snippets with P/Invoke signatures when relevant

## Output Format

Provide findings in structured format:
- **Solution**: Recommended approach
- **Code**: Key implementation snippets
- **Caveats**: Known issues or limitations
- **References**: Documentation links
